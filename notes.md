# Work to be done

- [] Grab the next upcoming event for NYAdventure Club
- [] Add an API that others can use to see the next upcoming event
- [] Some amount of test coverage

# Background
NY Adventure Club requested their own site that shows their next upcoming event
We can pretend we're adding to their existing Rails API backend

# Things to investigate
How do we auth with Meetup API?

Is this an open API or should it require any auth?
